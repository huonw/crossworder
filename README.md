# Crossworder

Reads a file specifying crossword clues and answers (and their position and direction), and outputs the crossword in LaTeX with options like whether to print answer or not, and the ability to change the formatting.

It detects mismatched letters, but doesn't check for clues running on to each other, or overlapping or anything like that.
